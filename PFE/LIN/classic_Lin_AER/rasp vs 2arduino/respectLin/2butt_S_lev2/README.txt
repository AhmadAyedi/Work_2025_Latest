that's the correct concept of LIN 
here we respected the LIN protocol rules

master always send headers in a cyclic period to check if a button is pressed
by one of the slaves 
and if an event is detected (master always check if something happen) 
it means if a master detect an event from one of the slaves 
then the slave send the response to the master indicating that the slave 
number 1 or 2 have pressed the button
and like that the frame is completed header sent by the master 
and response sent by the master


GOOD JOB That's the real functionning of LIN protocol
